## Getting Started

You will need to grab your own `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`. Head over to firebase.com and create a new application.

You will then need to modify your configuration files to match the Hacker News API:

`./android/app/google-services.json`:
```js
    "firebase_url": "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com"
```

`./ios/Hekla/GoogleService-Info.plist`
```xml
	<key>DATABASE_URL</key>
	<string>https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com</string>
```
